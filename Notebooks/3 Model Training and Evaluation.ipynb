    "\n",
    "The first layer will receive the input shape. As each sample contains 40 MFCCs (or columns) we have a shape of (1x40) this means we will start with an input shape of 40. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first two layers will have 256 nodes. The activation function we will be using for our first 2 layers is the `ReLU`, or `Rectified Linear Activation`. This activation function has been proven to work well in neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also apply a `Dropout` value of 50% on our first two layers. This will randomly exclude nodes from each update cycle which in turn results in a network that is capable of better generalisation and is less likely to overfit the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our output layer will have 10 nodes (num_labels) which matches the number of possible classifications. The activation is for our output layer is `softmax`. Softmax makes the output sum up to 1 so the output can be interpreted as probabilities. The model will then make its prediction based on which option has the highest probability."
